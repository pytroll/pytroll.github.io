title: Code of Conduct
---

All Pytroll projects and events follow a code of conduct. A link to the code
of conduct can be found in the
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the Pytroll package source
repositories.

This code of conduct applies to the
project space (GitHub) as well as the public space online and offline when
an individual is representing the project or the community. Online examples
of this include the Pytroll Slack team, mailing list, and the Pytroll mastodon
account. This code of conduct also applies to in-person situations like
Pytroll Contributor Weeks (PCW), conference meet-ups, or any other time when
the project is being represented.

Any violations of this code of conduct will be handled by the core maintainers
of the project including David Hoese, Martin Raspaud, and Adam Dybbroe.
If you wish to report one of the maintainers for a violation and are
not comfortable with them seeing it, please contact one or more of the other
maintainers to report the violation. Responses to violations will be
determined by the maintainers and may include one or more of the following:

- Verbal warning
- Ask for public apology
- Temporary or permanent ban from in-person events
- Temporary or permanent ban from online communication (Slack, mailing list, etc)
